# 1. Cat: not the pet, but the command!
This challenge requires us to read the flag from flag file from gome directroy using cat command.

## My Solve
Flag: pwn.college{Q2DPiwChjruOMbeQrtm_3LQUe7e.QXxcTN0wiM1AzNzEzW}

Cat is used to read out the files. I used "cat flag" to read out the flag from flag file.

hacker@commands~cat-not-the-pet-but-the-command:~$ cat flag
