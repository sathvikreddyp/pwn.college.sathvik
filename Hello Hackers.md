In a command line, we can write a program followed by an argument(parameter). We invoke a program and pass arguments to it. I simply invoked "hello" command and I got a flag!

## What I learnt
I learnt about three commands here: echo, echo -n, and cat. I learnt how to execute my first command in the terminal.

Echo command prints all its arguments back out into the terminal. I entered "hello' as the command and "hackers" as the argument seperated by space as instructed by them to get the desired output.

## What I learnt
I learnt the use of echo command and the meaning of argument and command.
