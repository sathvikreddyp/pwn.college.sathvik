# 1. Intro to Commands
This challenge asks us to execute our first command. We were asked to invoke the "hello" command in this case.

## My Solve
Flag: pwn.college{4yP5SQUrTr3qrlfMCutf2KY-qyv.QX3YjM1wiM1AzNzEzW}

In a command line, we can write a program followed by an argument(parameter). We invoke a program and pass arguments to it. I simply invoked "hello" command and I got a flag!

## What I learnt
I learnt about three arguments here: echo, echo -n, and cat. I learnt how to execute my first command in the terminal.

## References
The references were intructions and video provideed by the pwn.college.
